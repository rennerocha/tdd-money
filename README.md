What is this repository about?
==============================

It contains an implementation of a set of classes and functions to handle money operations driven entirely (or at least I tried) by tests.

It implements the Money Example from Part I of *Test Driven Development: By Example* from Kent Beck.

It uses Python instead of Java, so some design decisions are different from the book as the language allows different approaches to solve some issue found.
